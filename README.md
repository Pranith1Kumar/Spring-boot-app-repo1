# Spring-boot-app-repo1
This project creates a Spring Boot application using Spring Initializr, customizes it to meet specific needs, and then containerizes it using Docker. A Dockerfile is written to create a Docker image, which is then pushed to Dockerhub. Finally, the containerized application is made runnable, demonstrating a complete containerization process.
